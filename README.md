## Services used
Amazon S3: Amazon S3 is an object storage service that provides manufacturing scalability, data availability, security, and performance.

AWS IAM: This is nothing but identity and access management which enables us to manage access to AWS services and resources securely.

AWS Glue: Used for standard etl jobs, schema change crawlers to read the etl

AWS Athena: Athena is an interactive query service for S3 in which there is no need to load data it stays in S3.

Power BI: was used to create an analytical dashboard 

Details for all the data analysis information including the dashboard is found [HERE](https://github.com/iambigdan/Datazens-alpha-team-Datathon/tree/main/dashboard%20and%20data%20analysis)

SKlearning: was used to create a machine learning model [link to the ML model](https://github.com/iambigdan/Datazens-alpha-team-Datathon/blob/main/aws%20resources%20for%20data%20engineering/datazens_alpha_IAM_user_login.csv)
Details of the ml model and resources will be found [Here](https://github.com/iambigdan/Datazens-alpha-team-Datathon/tree/main/predictive%20model%20resources)
